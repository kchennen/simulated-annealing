# simple simulated annealing
This repo contains a very simple implementation of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a> based on the tutorial available [here].

## Installation
You can either download/clone this repo or pip install it as follows.
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nathanrooy/simulated-annealing
```

## Usage: continuous optimization
There are two modes of optimization currently available with this implementation of simulated annealing: `continuous` and `combinatorial`. We'll cover the continuous case first but prior to starting we'll need to specify a cost function. For this, we'll install the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nathanrooy/landscapes">Landscapes</a> optimization test function library with either of the following commands:
```sh
pip install landscapes
```
or 
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nathanrooy/landscapes
```
Now In a Python terminal, import the necessary dependencies. We'll use the `sphere` function from Landscapes to start off with since it's smooth and convex.
```python
>>> from simulated_annealing import sa
>>> from landscapes.single_objective import sphere
```
Next, let's specify the initial values and optimize. The value `x0` in this case is simply a random starting point with three degrees of freedom.
```python
>>> x0 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> opt = sa.minimize(sphere, x0, opt_mode='continuous', step_max=1000, t_max=1, t_min=0)
```
The results can be viewed with the following:
```python
>>> opt.results()
```
Which will yield something fairly close to this:
```python
+------------------------ RESULTS -------------------------+

      opt.mode: continuous
cooling sched.: linear additive cooling


  initial temp: 1
    final temp: 0.001000
     max steps: 1000
    final step: 1000

  final energy: 0.007882

+-------------------------- END ---------------------------+
```
For additional results, use `opt.best_state` to view the optimal parameters:
```python
>>> opt.best_state
[0.006638773548345078, -0.08591710990585566, -0.02136864187181653]
```
As well as `opt.best_energy` to display the cost function value with these parameters:
```python
>>> opt.best_energy
0.007882441944247037
```
## Usage: combinatorial optimization

## Cooling Schedules
There are several cooling schedules available with this implementation. They are as follows:
- linear
- exponential
- logarithmic
- quadratic
